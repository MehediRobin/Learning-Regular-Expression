##What-Are-Regular-Expressions?

Regular expressions are a tool for searching and matching parts of a text by describing the patterns that should be used to identify those parts.
A regular expression is a set of symbols that describes a text pattern.
The plural "expressions" refers to the larger formal language interpreted by a regular expression processor.
Regular expressions are not a programming language. They are used for matching, searching, and replacing text.
Most programming languages make lots of use of regular expressions.

###Usage-Example
You can perform complex activities by writing a description of the desired pattern using symbols:
* You can test if a credit card number has the correct number of digits
* Test if an email address is in a valid format
* Search a document for either "color" or "colour"
* Replace all occurrences of "Bob," "Bobby," or "B." with "Robert"
* Count how many times "training" is preceded by "computer," "video," or "online"

Once you set a pattern with the Regular Expressions, the regex processor will use the description to look for matching results.
